# Introduction

This document includes several formal specifications and test suites for **PICA Data Format**, also known as **PICA+**.

The individual specifications had been created in different forms starting in 2008, partly by reverse-engineering OCLC PICA software. 

- PICA+ serialization forms [PICA Normalized](pica-normalized.qmd), [PICA Plain](pica-plain.qmd) and [PICA XML](pica-xml.qmd)
- PICA modification and diff format [PICA Patch](pica-patch.qmd)
- PICA Locator language [PICA Path](pica-path.qmd) to refer to individual fields and subfields
- [PICA Filter](pica-filter.qmd) to query and select records
