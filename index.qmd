# Introduction

This document includes several formal specifications and test suites for **PICA Format**, also known as **PICA+**:

- [PICA Data Model](pica-model.qmd) defines the data model of PICA as foundation of all specifications
- Some serialization forms of PICA+
    - [PICA Normalized](pica-normalized.qmd)
    - [PICA Plain](pica-plain.qmd) 
    - [PICA XML](pica-xml.qmd)
- PICA Locator language [PICA Path](pica-path.qmd) to refer to individual fields and subfields
- PICA modification and diff format [PICA Diff/Patch](pica-diff.qmd)
- [PICA Filter](pica-filter.qmd) to query and select records

The individual specifications had been created and published in different forms starting in 2008, partly by reverse-engineering OCLC PICA software.
