# PICA XML

## Background

PICA XML without XML Namespace is being used to serve PICA+ records via SRU since the early 2000s. In 2006 the format was documented at VZG with XML Namespace and XML Schema, and a stable version 1.0 was published at July 3rd, 2008^[See <https://web.archive.org/web/20080913003622/http://www.gbv.de/wikis/cls/PICA_XML_Version_1.0>]. OCLC decided against officially adopting it, so alternative forms of encoding PICA in XML have evolved as well. The format is listed at <https://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/recordSchemas/> with identifier `info:srw/schema/5/picaXML-v1.0`.
