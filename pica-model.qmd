title: PICA Data Model
---

This chapter defines the data model of PICA+.

## Specification {.unnumbered}

A **collection** is a (possibly empty) sequence of **records**.

A **record** is a non-empty sequence of **fields**. The fields are sorted as described below.

A **field** is a pair of a **field identifier** and a non-empty list of **subfields**.

A **field identifier** consists of a **tag**, optionally followed by a slash (`/`)  followed by a **occurrence**

A **tag** is a sequence of four characters:

- the **level** being either `0`, `1`, or `2`
- two digits (also known as "type")
- an uppercase letter A to Z or @ (also known as "indicator")

An **occurrence** ...

A **subfield** is a pair of **subfield code** and **subfield value**.

A **subfield code** is one of the characters A-Z, a-z and 0-9.

A **subfield value** is a sequence of bytes not including any of the control codes (`#x00` to `#x1F`). Subfield values SHOULD be valid sequences Unicode code points encoded in UTF-8.

TODO: order of fields is relevant for records with multiple levels!
