title: PICA Normalized
---

PICA Normalized is the preferred machine-readable serialization of PICA records (although not widely used by OCLC CBS/LBS).
Each record is stored on a line. PICA fields end with byte code `#x1E` and subfields start with byte code `#x1F`.

The URI of this format is <https://format.gbv.de/pica/normalized>.

::: {.callout-warning}
Other PICA serialization formats are also referred to as "normalized" so the URI of the format should be used for reference.

## Specification

Individual records of a [PICA collection](pica-model.qmd) are separated by newline character (`#x0A`).

The last record MAY be terminated by an additional newline character (`#x0A`).

Each field is encoded as sequence of:

- the field identifier
- a space (`#x20`)
- the list subfields, each
  - ... 
- the byte `#x1F`
